# Problem Statement
Razorpay has recently validated that there’s a huge untapped potential (~5Mn businesses) in Tier 3/4 cities where the business owners or the employees are not well-versed with
English. Although businesses and customers here use online payment channels, the
adoption rate is extremely poor (<5% of all payments), and one of the primary reasons that
Razorpay has identified is the language barrier. Hence, Razorpay now wants to launch a
mobile app in local language which just lets the business create payment links where
customers can make payments. Businesses can track the payments and see reports (daily,
weekly, monthly aggregated customer-level data) on the app.

You need to conceptualise a solution, identify two cities in India where Razorpay should launch this MVP and propose features which should go with
this MVP. Also, analyze the risks and mitigation strategies around the proposed features.
